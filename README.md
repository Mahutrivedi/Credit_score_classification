The problem statement: You are working as a data scientist in the global finance company.  The company has collected lot of credit related information of many of their customers.  The company wants to segregate customers based on this information.  The company is currently doing the same process but manually, they want to minimize the manual effort and build an automated smart system.

Credit score classification is a very important task for finance company because based on credit: Good, Standard and poor; finance company can take decision whether to provide loan to the customer or not.  By adopting this strategy finance company can minimize their NPA (Non-performing asset), which is good for their financial growth.

This is a supervised machine learning and a classification task where we need to classify customers into Good, Standard and poor credit rating.
